# OAuth Authentication Flow Fix

## Issue

The application was encountering an error during the OAuth authentication flow with Google:

```
SvelteKitError: Not found: /login/callback
```

This error occurred because the OAuth redirect URI was misconfigured, causing a mismatch between where Google was redirecting after authentication and where our application was expecting to handle the callback.

## Root Cause

1. The OAuth configuration in `internal/auth/auth.go` was setting the `RedirectURL` to `http://localhost:8080/api/auth/callback`, which pointed to the backend server.
2. However, the frontend SvelteKit application didn't have a proper route to handle this callback.
3. When Google redirected to the backend after authentication, the backend wasn't properly communicating with the frontend.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix with the following changes:

1. **Created a dedicated callback page in the frontend**:
   - Added a new route at `/login/callback` (`web/src/routes/login/callback/+page.svelte`) to handle the OAuth callback
   - This page receives the authorization code from Google, exchanges it for a token via the backend, and redirects to the home page

2. **Updated the OAuth configuration**:
   - Changed the `RedirectURL` in `internal/auth/auth.go` to point to the frontend's callback page: `http://localhost:5173/login/callback`
   - This ensures Google redirects to a route that exists in our frontend application

3. **Added CORS support in the backend**:
   - Updated the backend to include proper CORS headers for all responses
   - This allows the frontend (running on port 5173) to make API requests to the backend (running on port 8080)

4. **Enhanced error handling and logging**:
   - Added detailed logging in both frontend and backend to help diagnose authentication issues
   - Improved error messages to provide better feedback during the authentication process

## Technical Details

The OAuth flow now works as follows:

1. User clicks "Login with Google" on the login page
2. Frontend redirects to Google's OAuth page
3. After authentication, Google redirects to `http://localhost:5173/login/callback` with an authorization code
4. The callback page exchanges this code for a token by making a POST request to the backend
5. The backend validates the code with Google, saves the token, and returns a success response
6. The frontend redirects to the home page, completing the authentication flow

This fix ensures a seamless authentication experience while maintaining proper separation between frontend and backend responsibilities.
